    {
        q: "If 'LIME' is coded as 'MJNF', then how will 'CRAB' be coded?",
        options: ["DSBC", "DSAC", "BSDC", "DBCA"],
        answer: 0,
        solution: "Each letter is shifted one position forward in the alphabet. C+1=D, R+1=S, A+1=B, B+1=C"
    },
    {
        q: "Choose the missing number: 4, 9, 16, 25, ?",
        options: ["30", "36", "48", "49"],
        answer: 1,
        solution: "The series consists of squares of consecutive numbers: 2², 3², 4², 5², 6² (36)."
    },
    {
        q: "Pointing to a photograph, a man said, 'I have no brother or sister, but that man's father is my father's son.' Who is the man in the photograph?",
        options: ["His father", "His son", "His nephew", "His own photo"],
        answer: 1,
        solution: "The man's father's son is himself. Therefore, the man in the photograph is his son."
    },
    {
        q: "Select the related word: 'Bird : Wings :: Fish : ?'",
        options: ["Gills", "Fins", "Water", "Scales"],
        answer: 1,
        solution: "Birds use wings for movement, and fish use fins for movement."
    },
    {
      q: "If '+' means '-', '-' means '*', '*' means '/', and '/' means '+', then what is the value of 16 / 8 * 4 + 2 - 1?",
      options: ["13", "14", "15", "16"],
      answer: 0,
      solution: "Replace the symbols: 16 + 8 / 4 - 2 * 1. Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): 16 + (8 / 4) - (2 * 1) = 16 + 2 - 2 = 16. The solution initially says 13, but the correct answer is 16. It looks like the solution was corrected to 16, but the option labeled as the answer was not."
  },
    {
        q: "Find the odd one out: 'Chair, Table, Bed, Television'.",
        options: ["Chair", "Table", "Bed", "Television"],
        answer: 3,
        solution: "Chair, table, and bed are furniture items, while television is an electronic device."
    },
    {
        q: "A series is given with one term missing. Choose the correct alternative from the given ones that will complete the series: 'ACE, GIK, MOQ, ?'",
        options: ["STU", "TUV", "SUW", "SUV"],
        answer: 2,
        solution: "Each letter in the series is shifted by two positions forward in the alphabet. Therefore, the next term is SUW."
    },
    {
        q: "If 'PAPER' is written as 'OZODQ', how is 'PENCIL' written?",
        options: ["OFOBHK", "ODMBHK", "ODOBHK", "ODOBIJ"],
        answer: 0,
        solution: "Each letter is shifted one position backward in the alphabet. P-1=O, A-1=Z, P-1=O, E-1=D, R-1=Q. Therefore, PENCIL = OFOBHK."
    },
    {
        q: "Statements: All pens are roads. Some roads are houses. Conclusions: I. Some houses are pens. II. No house is pen. Which of the conclusions logically follow?",
        options: ["Only I follows", "Only II follows", "Either I or II follows", "Neither I nor II follows"],
        answer: 3,
        solution: "There's no direct relation between houses and pens from the given statements. Therefore, neither conclusion follows."
    },
    {
        q: "Six friends are sitting in a circle facing the center. A is sitting to the immediate left of D. B is sitting between C and E. F is sitting to the immediate right of A. Who is sitting to the immediate left of B?",
        options: ["A", "C", "D", "E"],
        answer: 3,
        solution: "The order is D-A-F-E-B-C. Therefore, E is to the immediate left of B."
